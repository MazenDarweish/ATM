# ATM
This C program simulates an ATM system, designed to handle user account and transaction management using linked lists and CSV files. The program is modular, with separate header files (user.h, transaction.h, util.h) and corresponding source files (user.c, transaction.c, util.c), alongside a main file that ties everything together. It incorporates an encryption system to secure user passwords, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected and preventing unauthorized access or interception during login. Users interact with the system by logging in with a username and password, which are encrypted and validated against stored data. Once authenticated, they can perform various operations such as depositing funds, withdrawing money (with balance checks), viewing their current balance, and checking their transaction history. Each operation updates the user's account balance in real-time and records the transaction for later reference.
